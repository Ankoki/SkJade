# SkJade
A Skript Addon which provides useful hooks and utilities to Skript.

SkJade is getting a revamp (in my disky arc ig), hence this branch being created. Here are my proposed features which im going to implement.  
This might take a while so any bug fixes wont be addressed and instead ported to this branch.  
2.0 will require Skript-2.6, as I will be using the SectionAPI.

# Documentation

You can find documentation on SkriptHub or SkUnity!  
[![SkUnityDocs](https://skunity.com/branding/buttons/get_on_docs_4.png)](https://docs.skunity.com/syntax/search/from:skjade)  
[![SkriptHubViewTheDocs](http://skripthub.net/static/addon/ViewTheDocsButton.png)](http://skripthub.net/docs/?addon=SkJade)

I will also add tutorials on how to use 
seperate parts of SkJade to the wiki at some point, however when that point will be is a good question that I will not
answer. ‚ù§
